# Build Diary - Elegant Trading System UK Implementation

## Objective
Transform the elegant trading system into a fully functional live trading system using only free APIs and trading platforms available in the UK.

## Current State
- ✅ Core system architecture built
- ✅ All components implemented (market data, signals, risk, execution, monitoring)
- ❌ Currently uses paid exchange APIs (Binance, Coinbase)
- ❌ No real execution capability
- ❌ Need UK-compliant free trading solution

## Constraints
1. **Location**: UK-based trader
2. **Cost**: Zero cost for APIs and trading
3. **Assets**: Need liquid markets (crypto preferred for 24/7 trading)
4. **Data**: Need real-time order book data
5. **Execution**: Need programmatic trading capability

## Research Findings

### Free Trading Options in UK

1. **Alpaca Markets**
   - ✅ Free paper trading API
   - ✅ Real market data (15-min delayed free, live data needs subscription)
   - ❌ US stocks only
   - ❌ Crypto trading not available in UK

2. **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)**
   - ✅ API access with account
   - ❌ Monthly fees unless high volume
   - ❌ Not truly free

3. **Crypto Options**:
   - **Binance** - Has testnet but requires real API for market data
   - **KuCoin** - Free API tier with rate limits
   - **Gate.io** - Free API tier
   - **MEXC** - Free API tier

4. **Paper Trading + Real Data Hybrid**:
   - Use free market data APIs
   - Simulate execution locally
   - Track performance as if real

## Proposed Solution

### Architecture: Hybrid Paper Trading System

```
Real Market Data (Free Tier)
    ↓
Signal Generation
    ↓
Paper Execution Engine
    ↓
Performance Tracking
```

### Components Needed

1. **Market Data Sources** (Free):
   - CryptoCompare API (free tier: 100k calls/month)
   - CoinGecko API (free tier: 50 calls/minute)
   - Binance public API (no auth needed for market data)
   - WebSocket feeds from exchanges

2. **Execution Layer**:
   - Paper trading engine that simulates real execution
   - Slippage modeling based on order book depth
   - Realistic fee calculation

3. **Optional Future Path**:
   - Start with paper trading
   - Build track record
   - Move to funded account when profitable

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Data Infrastructure
1. Replace paid exchange connections with free alternatives
2. Implement WebSocket connections for real-time data
3. Create order book aggregator for free sources

### Phase 2: Paper Trading Engine
1. Build execution simulator with realistic slippage
2. Implement virtual portfolio tracking
3. Add fee calculations (maker/taker)

### Phase 3: Live System
1. Run paper trading for 30 days
2. Analyze performance
3. Decision point: continue paper or go live

## What I Need From User

1. **Preferred Assets**:
   - Crypto only? (recommended for 24/7 and free data)
   - Or include stocks? (limited free options)

2. **Risk Capital** (for future live trading):
   - Amount you'd be comfortable trading with
   - This affects position sizing calculations

3. **Time Commitment**:
   - Can you monitor the system daily?
   - Or needs to be fully autonomous?

4. **Exchange Preference**:
   - Any existing exchange accounts?
   - Preferred exchanges for future live trading?

5. **Performance Tracking**:
   - Want a web dashboard?
   - Or command-line reports sufficient?

## Next Steps

Based on your answers, I will:
1. Implement free data sources
2. Build paper trading engine
3. Create monitoring dashboard
4. Set up automated reporting

## Technical Decisions

### Data Source Selection
- **Primary**: Binance public WebSocket (no auth, real-time)
- **Secondary**: CryptoCompare REST API (aggregated data)
- **Backup**: CoinGecko for price verification

### Paper Trading Logic
```python
class PaperExecutionEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.virtual_balance = 10000  # Starting paper balance
        self.positions = {}
        self.order_history = []
        
    def execute_order(self, order):
        # Simulate slippage based on order book
        slippage = self.calculate_slippage(order)
        fill_price = order.price * (1 + slippage)
        
        # Apply fees
        fee = order.quantity * fill_price * 0.001  # 0.1% fee
        
        # Update virtual portfolio
        self.update_portfolio(order, fill_price, fee)
```

### Monitoring Solution
- Local SQLite database for trade history
- Prometheus + Grafana for metrics (both free)
- Daily email reports via SendGrid free tier

## Risk Considerations

1. **Paper vs Live Differences**:
   - No emotional pressure in paper trading
   - Slippage might be underestimated
   - Need realistic fee modeling

2. **Free API Limitations**:
   - Rate limits (must respect)
   - Potential data delays
   - Less reliable than paid tiers

3. **UK Regulatory**:
   - Crypto trading is legal
   - No issues with personal trading bots
   - Keep records for tax purposes

## Progress Tracking

- [ ] Get user requirements
- [ ] Implement free data sources
- [ ] Build paper execution engine
- [ ] Create monitoring system
- [ ] Run 30-day paper trading test
- [ ] Analyze results and decide on live trading

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-01
**Status**: GOING LIVE IMMEDIATELY

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

User directive: Go live ASAP. No testing. No preferences. Just make it trade.

### Selected Solution:

3. **Send me**:
   - KuCoin API Key
   - KuCoin API Secret  
   - KuCoin API Passphrase
   - Confirmation that you have USDT in your account

I will then immediately deploy the live trading system.
